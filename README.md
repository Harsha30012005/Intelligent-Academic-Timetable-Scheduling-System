# 🎓 Intelligent Academic Timetable Scheduling System

## 🚀 Overview

The **Intelligent Academic Timetable Scheduling System** is an AI-driven deliberative planning agent designed to automatically generate optimized, conflict-free academic timetables for universities and educational institutions.

The system integrates:

- Constraint Satisfaction (CSP)
- Optimization Techniques
- Hybrid AI Planning Strategies

to handle complex academic scheduling constraints efficiently.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Academic timetable generation involves multiple interdependent constraints:

- Teacher availability  
- Classroom capacity  
- Laboratory requirements  
- Batch overlaps  
- Faculty workload limits  
- Time slot balancing  
- Resource utilization  

Manual scheduling often leads to:

- Conflicts  
- Inefficient resource usage  
- Imbalanced workload  
- Human errors  
- Time-consuming adjustments  

This system automates the entire process using AI-based decision-making.
