Intelligent Academic Timetable Scheduling System
Overview
The Intelligent Academic Timetable Scheduling System is an AI-driven deliberative planning agent designed to automatically generate optimized, conflict-free academic timetables for universities and educational institutions.

The system uses Constraint Satisfaction, Optimization techniques, and Hybrid AI planning strategies to handle complex academic scheduling constraints efficiently.

Problem Statement
Academic timetable generation involves multiple interdependent constraints:

Teacher availability

Classroom capacity

Laboratory requirements

Batch overlaps

Faculty workload limits

Time slot balancing

Resource utilization

Manual scheduling leads to:

Conflicts

Inefficient resource allocation

Uneven distribution

Last-minute adjustments

This system automates the entire process using AI-based decision-making.
